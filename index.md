<h4 id="section1">Personalized Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering</h4>

This project aims to develop a personalized movie recommendation system by leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to enhance user experience. Using the MovieLens dataset, which includes approximately 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,664 movies, the system employs R's `recommenderlab` package to build both user-based and item-based recommendation models. Initial data exploration involves preprocessing and normalizing the ratings to prepare the dataset for modeling. The user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) model recommends movies based on similar user preferences, while the item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) model suggests movies similar to those previously rated by the user.

The project evaluates the performance of these models based on relevance, novelty, serendipity, and diversity of the recommendations. The user-based model demonstrated varied success in relevance, providing novel suggestions but showing limited overlap with user preferences. It also offered some serendipitous and diverse recommendations, though not across a broad temporal range. The item-based model performed better in providing consistent recommendations based on item similarity and was effective in suggesting relevant movies. Overall, the project successfully showcases the potential of collaborative filtering to deliver personalized recommendations, with room for improvement in recommendation breadth and alignment with user interests.

<h4 id="section2">California Housing Data Association Rules Analysis**</h4>

This project applies association rule mining to the California Housing Data from Kaggle to uncover patterns in housing attributes. The primary goal is to analyze and understand associations between different features such as total rooms, median income, and housing values. By implementing the apriori algorithm, the project aims to identify significant rules that offer insights into housing characteristics and guide practical recommendations for potential buyers.

The analysis highlighted key insights, including that high total rooms and average population correlate with certain household configurations. It also identified that higher median incomes are associated with lower population areas. For those seeking homes near the ocean, the most favorable characteristics include an average median age, fewer bedrooms, and higher house values. In low-population areas, key features include high house values, fewer bedrooms, small household sizes, and moderate to high incomes. The project effectively demonstrated the ability to derive actionable insights from housing data, offering valuable recommendations for both potential buyers and urban planners.

<h4 id="section3">Grocery Data Analysis and Association Rules</h4>

This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from a grocery store to uncover item associations and purchase patterns. The primary goal is to identify patterns that can inform sales strategies and optimize product placement, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the visibility and sales of specific product categories.

Through data visualization and association rule mining, the project reveals frequent item purchases and identifies strong relationships between products. The analysis highlights key insights such as high-confidence associations and significant patterns that can drive marketing and merchandising decisions. By implementing these findings, the store can develop targeted promotions, improve product bundling strategies, and enhance inventory management, ultimately leading to increased sales and better customer satisfaction.

<h4 id="section4">Market Basket Analysis for RM Customer Purchase Behavior</h4>

This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior by examining transactional data from RM's loyalty card system. The focus is on uncovering patterns of product associations to inform pricing strategies, display optimizations, and promotional effectiveness. By leveraging market basket analysis, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance RM's sales strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

The project involves preprocessing the raw transactional data to create a binary transaction matrix, where each matrix entry indicates whether a product was purchased. This matrix is used for data analysis using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and association rules. The analysis highlights significant product associations, which are ranked by lift to identify the strongest relationships. Insights from this analysis suggest strategic adjustments to product placements and promotional offers based on observed purchasing patterns. Recommendations include optimizing store layouts and implementing targeted promotions to align with customer buying behaviors, ultimately aiming to boost sales and enhance customer engagement.

<h4 id="section5">Bank of Buffalo DBMS Project</h3>

This DBMS project aims to modernize and streamline the management of banking information, enhancing customer interactions and operational efficiency. The system captures comprehensive data related to the bank’s branches, employees, customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and insurance services. The primary goal is to create an intuitive and robust database where information retrieval is simplified through structured relationships and normalized tables, ensuring easy access and management for both bank staff and customers. This customer-centric approach facilitates seamless transactions and account management, improving overall service delivery.

The project involves detailed steps including data analysis, creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, and designing and normalizing database tables. The ER diagram outlines the relationships between entities such as branches, employees, and accounts, ensuring accurate data linkage and integrity. The database implementation encompasses designing tables with proper foreign key constraints to represent one-to-many relationships, such as between branches and employees or accounts and transactions. This systematic approach not only supports efficient data handling and retrieval but also enhances the bank’s ability to offer personalized services and streamlined operations.

End-to-end SQL scripts were developed from scratch, covering Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and other database operations. These scripts facilitate the creation, updating, and management of the database, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of data. Queries derived from this database can generate valuable insights, such as customer transaction patterns, loan and insurance distribution, and employee performance metrics, supporting data-driven decision-making and improving overall banking operations.
